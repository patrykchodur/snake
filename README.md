# Rust Snake
This is a snake game implemented in rust. The main purpose of the game
is for me to learn rust and Terminal User Interface development, here
using [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/) library.

## Usage
Just clone the project and run

cargo run
```

## TODOs
- Move items when map resized
- Add some UI info on the right
- Add option to change speed
- Change colors
- Create Snake class with methods like `contains` etc.
