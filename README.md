# Rust Snake
This is a snake game implemented in rust. The main purpose of the game
is for me to learn rust and Terminal User Interface development, here
using [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/) library.

## Usage
Just clone the project and run
```
cargo run
```

## TODOs
- Move items when map resized
- Don't use the full terminal for playing
    - Add some UI info on the right
- Add option to restart the game
    - Take a look how tabs are done in ratatui tutorials for menu
- Add some options like map size or speed
- Change colors
- Add next move to array, so we can have a few in a row
- Create Snake class with methods like `contains` etc.
